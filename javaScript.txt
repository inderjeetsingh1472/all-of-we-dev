Java-Script:-
1.we declare a variable mainly using three types of keywords:-
-Var : -
• Function Scope or Global Scope: Variables declared with var have function scope if declared inside a function. If declared outside any function, they become global variables.

• Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or script. This means they can be accessed before their actual declaration.

• No Block Scope: Unlike let and const, variables declared with var do not have block scope. They are accessible throughout the function in which they are declared, regardless of block boundaries.

• Reassignment and Redefinition: Variables declared with var can be both redeclared and reassigned within the same scope without throwing errors. This can lead to unintended consequences and difficult-to-trace bugs.
